Step-by-step walkthrough of my process in completing the Basic Pentesting room on TryHackMe

The target is a virtual machine designed to be exploited to practice web app hacking and privilege escalation

WALKTHROUGH

Begin with nmap scan to identify open ports and services running
  Identify multiple open ports and vulnerable services running - tomcat, ajp smb, ssh
  Focus on web app to start

Use dirbuster to enumerate for hidden directory on web server
  [flag]

Access hidden directory via browser and access text files within
  Identify that "J" has a weak password and has been instructed to change by "K"
  J will be the first target

Use msfconsole scanner/http/tomcat_mgr_login to brute force manager login using default credentials
  No yield

Use enum4linux 
  Let run, takes a while
  Retrieve two usernames [flags]

Use hydra against the username "J--"
  Knowing they have a weak password, begin with rockyou wordlist
  Yield password [flag]

Access machine via shh
  Gain access using harvested credentials

Begin manually enumerating machine and privilege escalation options
  sudo -l
    No yield, jan has no sudo privileges on basic2
  Navigate back to home and explore other user directory
  kay's folder is full of interesting files
    pass.bak is stored out in the open with limited access
    There are hidden folders and keys stored in hidden .ssh/ directory
      cat both files and save them on my machine

Try using ssh -i to connect back to target machine using kays id_rsa (private ssh key)
  requires password

Use ssh2john to convert id_rsa to something crackable by john the ripper
  store out put as new file
    ssh2john id_rsa > kayjohnd

Use john the ripper against that file with rockyou wordlist
  $ john kayjohnd --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
    yield password

Repeat ssh -i attempt armed with key password
  gain access!

Dropped into kays folder
  cat pass.bak
  [flag]
Change kays password 

This process was effective for the activity but not thorough in terms of linux enumeration in the final step
  While efficacy is the name of the game, developing skills is crucial to that end - I might not be so lucky next time
Thanks to John Hammond's walkthrough I was introduced to linPEAS
    https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS
The output was incredibly thorough and digestible considering its volume. I'll keep this handy for next time. Thanks to both creators
